            <p>Hello and welcome to my professional portfolio website! My name is Hanna and I am currently a student in
                CTI
                110 which is Web, Programming, and Database Foundations.
                As a main focus of this class, us students created a portfolio project on a subject that we felt
                mattered to
                us the most. As I am in my senior year of my undergraduate degree,
                I felt that it would be important for me to base my project on my previous and current professions so
                that
                future employers could get to know a little more about me...
            </p><br>
            <p>As I previously mentioned, this website will be a chance for employers to get to know a little about me
                outside of my resume, cover letter, or job application. In order to make this happen, I created separate
                pages that give information on
                who I am as an employer, a student, what my skillsets are, and my life outside of work or school such as
                my
                hobbies!
            </p>
